<h3 class="job-title" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Clinical Research</h3>

                   <p> • I have been analyzing tumor related clinical data by using local medical database of hospitals and health-care
                    centers, public medical database from internet (SEER, GEO, TCGA ect.), and especially focusing on the epidemiology and
                    screening strategy of breast cancer and thyroid cancer in Chinese population. Besides, I have been collecting clinical
                    data and trying to analyze the relationship between breast cancer and other diseases, such as thyroid diseases, liver
                    diseases (viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, metabolic related fatty liver disease), diabetes mellitus,
                    cardiovascular diseases etc. And I have mastered statistics analysis and data-mining with R or SAS projects.</p>
                <p> • Currently, I have published 17 papers, of which 14 were SCI (Science Citation Index) papers (including 7 fist author
                    SCI papers). One of my first-author original article was published on Thyroid (IF 7.8), which currently is the top one
                    journal in the area of thyroid diseases. And another co-first author Letter with original data was published on the
                    Journal of Hepatology (IF18.9). I also have participated in the editing and publishing of five books about thyroid and
                    breast health, including “Breast oncological endocrinology and metabolism”, “Breast Oncocardiology”, “Concomitant
                    Disease of Breast Cancer”, “Fundamentals of Surgical Operation”, “Caring for Parathyroid Health”.</p>
                <p> • Additionally, I have a certain ability of critical thinking and logical thinking, and I have published three comment
                    papers (as first author) in prestigious journals, including JAMA (IF 51.3), Diabetes Care (IF 15.3) and Diabetologia (IF
                    7.1), in which I pinpointed their design defects in original studies and provide corresponding solutions.</p>

        <p> <strong>  Project 1</strong>: Effects of different physiological levels of estradiol on the chemosensitivity of HR+ breast cancer</p>
        <p> • <strong>Aim:</strong> To explore the effects of different physiological levels of estradiol (E2) on the chemosensitivity of breast
            cancer to epirubicin (EPI).</p>
        <p> •<strong> Methods:</strong> CCK-8 assay was used to observe the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with E2 (0, 50, 500,
            2500, 5000, 10000pg/ml) for 24h．After pretreatment with different doses of E2 for 12h and then treated with EPI alone
            for 24h, the effects of E2 on the chemosensitivity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to EPI were detected by CCK-8 assay.
            MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly assigned to Non-OVX+EPI group (group B), OVX+EPI group (group D), OVX+E2+EPI
            group (group E, F and G) and control group. After being treated with EPI, tumor inhibition rates were calculated to
            detect the effects of E2 on tumor inhibition of EPI chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>  •<strong>Conclusion:</strong> E2 dose-dependently promoted the chemosensitivity of MCF-7 cells to EPI, suggested that applied the
            chemotherapy in physiological periods with higher E2 level might improve the chemotherapy efficacy in HR+ breast cancer.</p>
        <p> •<strong> Major Responsibility: </strong>1. Retrieve and review relevant literatures 2. Participate in experimental design and
            responsible for the operation of some experiments, such as cell culture, tumors-bearing of naked mice, surgery of
            animals etc. 3. Data analysis and statistical graphs drawing 4. Discussion of the results and conclusion.</p>

            conference. 15th Shanghai International Breast Cancer Symposium. 2020: E002.</p>
            
        <p>  <strong>Project 2:</strong> Effect of dexamethasone during chemotherapy of breast cancer</p>
        <p>  • <strong>Aim: </strong>To investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on the anticancer activity of anthracycline chemotherapy in
            routine TAC chemotherapy regimen of breast cancer.</p>
        <p> • <strong>Methods:</strong> The effects of different concentrations of dexamethasone combined with doxorubicin on the viability of breast
            cancer cells were detected by CCK-8. Flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of dexamethasone and doxorubicin on
            breast cancer cells apoptosis rate; real-time quantitative PCR and western blot were used to detect the effects of
            different concentrations of dexamethasone and doxorubicin on the expression of bcl-2 family related genes and protein.</p>
        <p> • <strong>Conclusion:</strong>The conventional dexamethasone dosage in TAC chemotherapy regimen may reduce the effect of doxorubicin
            chemotherapy by inhibiting the apoptosis pathway of bcl-2, promote the proliferation activity of breast cancer cells in
            vitro and inhibit the apoptosis of cells. Therefore, TAC chemotherapy should be avoided using dexamethasone.</p>
